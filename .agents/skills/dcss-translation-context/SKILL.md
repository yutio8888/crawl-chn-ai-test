description: Load the current DCSS Chinese glossary and enforce terminology checks for translation, i18n code changes, translation reviews, and terminology decisions. Use whenever work touches T_(), C_(), zh/source.txt, ZH TextDB files, translated game text, or docs/glossary.md.

# DCSS Translation Context

Use `docs/glossary.md` from the current worktree as the only terminology data
source. Do not rely on remembered terms or copy glossary rows into this Skill.

## Start Every Applicable Task

From the repository root, choose the task type and run:

```bash
bash .claude/scripts/context_resolve.sh "<task description>" \
  --task-type <translate|code|review> --files <target-files>
```

Read and apply the complete output before editing or reviewing. Keep the emitted
glossary SHA-256 and include it in the final report. If `docs/glossary.md` changes
during the task, rerun the command before continuing.

For an ambiguous term, request it explicitly rather than guessing:

```bash
python3 .claude/scripts/glossary_query.py --term "<English term>"
```

Multiple listed target forms are allowed alternatives only when their comments
fit the current context. A new translation decision belongs in
`docs/glossary.md`; regenerate `docs/glossary.utf8` with the project exporter.

## Shared Safety Policy

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: i18n-safety -->
# i18n-safety-v2

This policy is the shared safety contract for DCSS Chinese i18n code.

- `T_()` and `C_()` return borrowed pointers that become invalid after
  `i18n_cache_clear()`. Never retain them in static or namespace storage,
  members, persistent containers, aggregates, or callback captures.
- Persistent literal tables use `N_("key")` or
  `NC_("context", "key")`, then translate at the consumption site with the
  matching `T_()` or `C_()`. Copy the result to `std::string` if it crosses a
  statement boundary.
- Never pass a `std::string`, concatenation, ternary promoted to
  `std::string`, or a `std::string`-returning call directly to a printf-style
  variadic `%s` slot. Store it locally and pass `.c_str()`.
- Treat every `CALL_NO_CSTR` scanner warning as requiring manual return-type
  confirmation: `const char *` is safe; `std::string` needs `.c_str()`.
- Never pass translated text to English morphology such as `conj_verb()`.
- Movement phrases remain English internal values until the display sink.
  Translate them with `translated_move_phrase()` and the applicable grammar
  context; update `move_i18n_manifest.json` and require exact-key coverage.
- Keep protocol, lookup, serialization, Lua comparison, and TextDB key values
  in English. Translate only at display boundaries.
- Use `mprf_p` for positional `%n$s` formats and never mix positional and
  sequential placeholders.
- Resolve terminology from the current `docs/glossary.md` immediately before
  work. Do not embed canonical Chinese terms in Agent or Skill configuration.

Configuration checks validate this policy's generated blocks. C++ source
analysis remains the responsibility of `scan_i18n_lifetime.py`,
`scan_varargs_string.py`, and the other code verification gates.
<!-- END GENERATED: i18n-safety -->

For every C++ task touching `T_()`/`C_()`, run the lifetime gate:

```bash
python3 .claude/scripts/scan_i18n_lifetime.py crawl-ref/source/ --require-parser
python3 .claude/scripts/i18n_extract.py validate crawl-ref/source/ \
  --source-txt crawl-ref/source/dat/i18n/zh/source.txt
```

## Verify

Run the profile matching the work:

```bash
bash .claude/scripts/verify_zh.sh --profile translation
bash .claude/scripts/verify_zh.sh --profile code
bash .claude/scripts/verify_zh.sh --profile review
```

The verification includes export freshness and changed exact-key terminology.
Use `GLOSSARY_DIFF_BASE=<revision>` when the comparison base is not `HEAD`.

## Shared Review Contract

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: review-contract -->
# review-contract-v2

All translation-related reviewers use one finding model:

- **Blocker**: runtime/functional failure, undefined behaviour, protocol or
  lookup corruption, structural data damage, compilation failure, or an
  incomplete/interrupted required verification.
- **Needs Fix**: a definite semantic, terminology, accuracy, completeness, or
  language error without runtime corruption.
- **Suggestion**: a non-required style preference.

Verdicts are derived mechanically:

- **Go**: `blocker == 0` and `needs_fix == 0`.
- **Conditional Go**: `blocker == 0` and `needs_fix > 0`, with explicit,
  verifiable conditions.
- **No-Go**: `blocker > 0`, or required verification did not complete.

Reviewer ownership is deliberately non-overlapping:

- `zh-code-reviewer` owns runtime safety, protocol/display separation,
  extraction and key coverage, format arguments, TextDB structure, borrowed
  translation lifetime, variadic calls, movement phrase routing, English
  morphology, compilation, and manual triage of scanner warnings.
- `translation-reviewer` owns EN/ZH semantic parity, current-glossary choices
  in context, facts and numbers, completeness, natural Chinese, terminology
  consistency, and character voice. It does not re-review implementation
  mechanics except to report a code defect it directly encounters.

Both reviewers must resolve the current glossary and report its SHA-256. They
must preserve and link raw verification output, then interpret every relevant
failure or warning against the target diff. Raw results may not be hidden or
rewritten; attaching a log is not a substitute for analysis.

Every finding includes an identifier, severity, exact file and line, evidence,
impact, and a concrete fix. Translation findings also include the EN source and
current ZH text. The final report includes finding counts, verdict, raw log
path, review scope, and glossary SHA-256.

Merge-time reviews additionally emit a schema-v2 record through
`record_review.sh`. The record includes a unique `review_id`, verification
`run_id`, immutable `base`, `head`, and binary `diff_hash`, glossary SHA-256,
raw log path (and metadata path when the run belongs to another worktree), and
non-empty `conditions` for Conditional Go. A verdict is not merge evidence
until `review_at_merge.sh --record-verdict ... <review-id>` validates that
record against a completed `status=pass` run.
