# zh-code-reviewer Skill

Use `.claude/agents/zh-code-reviewer.md` for code/i18n implementation review.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: review-contract -->
# review-contract-v4

Translation-related review separates domain review from expensive final
verification. A reviewer never runs `verify_zh.sh --profile review` during the
readiness pass; that profile is executed once by `review_final_gate.sh` after
all required reviewers are ready.

## Cost-aware orchestration

Development feedback uses targeted tests and only the profile that matches the
current edit. Do not serially run `translation`, `code`, and `ci` against the
same immutable mixed candidate: when one combined static preflight is useful,
run `ci` once. These development profiles are not schema-v4 final evidence.

Create the immutable bundle and complete routed domain review before running
expensive independent suites such as `run_all.sh`, `help-full`, or
`post_zh_runtime.sh full`. If the task or release contract requires those
suites, run each once only after all reviewers report Ready, against the exact
candidate OID that will enter the final gate. A reviewer-requested fix creates a
new bundle and uses targeted checks during the next feedback loop; do not spend
full-suite evidence on a candidate already known to need changes.

`review_prepare.sh`, routed readiness, `review_final_gate.sh`, and
`review_at_merge.sh` remain separate security boundaries. Their repeated
identity and clean-worktree checks are intentional and must not be removed as
performance optimizations.

## Finding model

- **Blocker**: runtime/functional failure, undefined behaviour, protocol or
  lookup corruption, structural data damage, compilation failure, failure to
  review the complete prepared diff, an unmet confirmed acceptance criterion
  within that diff, or an interrupted required verification.
- **Needs Fix**: a definite semantic, terminology, accuracy, completeness, or
  language error without runtime corruption.
- **Suggestion**: a non-required style preference.

Readiness is derived mechanically:

- **Ready for Final Gate**: `blocker == 0` and `needs_fix == 0`.
- **Changes Requested**: `blocker == 0` and `needs_fix > 0`.
- **No-Go**: `blocker > 0` or the reviewer could not complete the exact scope.

Suggestions do not block readiness. Schema-v4 merge authorization has no
Conditional Go: a definite fix is completed before final verification, while
deployment or release conditions are outside the immutable code-review proof.

Plan non-goals do not excuse defects introduced by the prepared diff. Reviewers
inspect the complete immutable diff for real runtime, semantic, structural, and
verification defects. A theoretical risk outside the task acceptance criteria
is non-blocking unless the prepared diff creates or materially worsens it.

When proposing a resolution, prefer deleting unnecessary design, reusing
repository mechanisms, and narrowing the commitment, in that order. Add a new
mechanism only when those options are insufficient.

## Reviewer ownership

- `zh-code-reviewer` owns runtime safety, protocol/display separation,
  extraction and key coverage, format arguments, TextDB structure, borrowed
  translation lifetime, variadic calls, movement phrase routing, English
  morphology, compilation, and scanner warning triage.
- `translation-reviewer` owns EN/ZH semantic parity, current-glossary choices
  in context, facts and numbers, completeness, natural Chinese, terminology
  consistency, and character voice. It reports implementation defects it
  encounters but does not duplicate the code reviewer's primary scope.

For mixed changes, each reviewer stays within that ownership and inspects the
shared context/fallback boundary only where the two domains meet. Neither
reviewer reruns whole-project verification suites during readiness.

The mechanically generated routing for the immutable target/candidate range is
authoritative. Mixed changes require both readiness records; a final evidence
approver cannot replace a missing domain readiness record.

## Immutable readiness

Before review, the candidate changes must be committed and its worktree must be
clean. From the clean target checkout, the orchestrator runs
`review_prepare.sh <candidate> <target>` and gives every reviewer that exact
bundle ID and range; a reviewer returns No-Go if this immutable boundary is
missing or mismatched. The target checkout must remain clean through the final
gate. Each readiness record binds the exact
target head, candidate head, binary diff SHA-256, glossary SHA-256, routing
digest, reviewer role, reviewed scope, and the complete structured findings
array. Any ref, diff,
glossary, or routing change invalidates the record.

Every finding is persisted inside the reviewer's atomic readiness object and
cites a unique id, severity, exact file and line, evidence, impact, and a
concrete fix. Translation-reviewer findings also include the English source and
current Chinese text. The tool derives severity counts and readiness from this
array; callers never supply either value independently. Reviewer identity in
local evidence is an audit declaration, not a cryptographic signature.

## Final evidence

After every required reviewer returns Ready, the orchestrator runs:

`TERM=xterm-256color bash .claude/scripts/review_final_gate.sh <candidate> <target>`

The explicit `TERM` assignment is required for headless or automated runs. A
shell may expose a non-exported fallback such as `TERM=dumb` to interactive
expansion while leaving `TERM` absent from `printenv` and therefore absent from
the final gate's sanitized Python child environment. Ncurses then treats the
terminal type as `unknown`, Crawl exits with code 1, and the `zh-smoke` phase
fails even though the candidate is unrelated to terminal handling. Supplying a
known installed terminal type is environment initialization, not a verification
bypass; all final-gate phases still run and bind the same immutable candidate.
Use the same prefix with `--retry-failed` after correcting this environment.

The final gate uses the target checkout's trusted control-plane, holds a
bundle-specific lock, and creates a new attempt only when no valid pass exists.
Failed, interrupted, abandoned, incomplete, or tampered attempts never approve
a merge. A valid pass is reused and never rerun for the same bundle.

The final evidence approver inspects the published verification artifacts and
records a final Go bound to the verification digest, routing digest, and every
required readiness digest. `review_at_merge.sh` is a read-only validator: it
does not build, test, create, repair, or update evidence.

Historical schema-v1/v2 log records and schema-v3 bundles remain read-only
metrics only. New merge authorization is written exclusively as a schema-v4
bundle with schema-v2 readiness. Old records are never upgraded, appended to,
or converted into a schema-v4 Go.

# i18n-safety-v2

This policy is the shared safety contract for DCSS Chinese i18n code.

- `T_()` and `C_()` return borrowed pointers that become invalid after
  `i18n_cache_clear()`. Never retain them in static or namespace storage,
  members, persistent containers, aggregates, or callback captures.
- Persistent literal tables use `N_("key")` or
  `NC_("context", "key")`, then translate at the consumption site with the
  matching `T_()` or `C_()`. Copy the result to `std::string` if it crosses a
  statement boundary.
- Never pass a `std::string`, concatenation, ternary promoted to
  `std::string`, or a `std::string`-returning call directly to a printf-style
  variadic `%s` slot. Store it locally and pass `.c_str()`.
- Treat every `CALL_NO_CSTR` scanner warning as requiring manual return-type
  confirmation: `const char *` is safe; `std::string` needs `.c_str()`.
- Never pass translated text to English morphology such as `conj_verb()`.
- Movement phrases remain English internal values until the display sink.
  Translate them with `translated_move_phrase()` and the applicable grammar
  context; update `move_i18n_manifest.json` and require exact-key coverage.
- Keep protocol, lookup, serialization, Lua comparison, and TextDB key values
  in English. Translate only at display boundaries.
- When a changed value may serve both identity and display, enumerate its
  producer, every intermediate consumer, and its final sinks. Identity and
  lookup paths use the original value or an English accessor (for example,
  `_god_name_en()`); only display sinks localize it. Cover the real lookup and
  fallback path with a targeted test.
- Use `mprf_p` for positional `%n$s` formats and never mix positional and
  sequential placeholders.
- Resolve terminology from the current `docs/glossary.md` immediately before
  work. Do not embed canonical Chinese terms in Agent or Skill configuration.

Configuration checks validate this policy's generated blocks. C++ source
analysis remains the responsibility of `scan_i18n_lifetime.py`,
`scan_varargs_string.py`, and the other code verification gates.

## Shared Verification Authoring

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: verification-authoring -->
# verification-authoring-v1

This policy applies when an agent writes or reviews a validator, scanner,
deployment check, parser-facing test, or other verification control.

- Enumerate the complete production artifact and its invariants before writing
  the check. Counts alone never prove identity, membership, uniqueness, order,
  content, conservation, or rejection of unknown data.
- Match production semantics for the parser, working directory,
  initialization, locale, environment, and compile/runtime options. Prefer the
  production helper or entry point. If a test must reimplement semantics,
  document the difference and cover it with a strict end-to-end check.
- Exercise the real construction, lookup, fallback, or deployment path. A
  relaxed helper test is insufficient unless a stricter end-to-end test covers
  the behaviour it omits.
- Fail closed when required input is missing, parsing is incomplete, an unknown
  field or state appears, or the complete invariant cannot be evaluated. Expose
  the failure through the validator's existing interface, normally a non-zero
  exit or an existing structured unresolved result. This requirement does not
  introduce a new result protocol, parser, persistent state, distributed
  coordination, recovery mechanism, or general compiler.
- Give every invariant a passing fixture and a minimal negative mutation that
  breaks only that invariant and must be rejected.
- Preserve raw tool evidence. Report the exact command, exit code, blocking
  failure count, relevant warnings, and the reason a failure is or is not
  actionable.

Reviewers reject checks that validate only source tokens or a convenient subset
when the production consumer observes a larger effective artifact.
<!-- END GENERATED: verification-authoring -->

Resolve current terminology, inspect the exact committed diff and existing
development/targeted logs, and explain every relevant failure or warning. Do
not run the review profile. Report file/line evidence, finding counts,
mechanically derived readiness, immutable bundle id, and glossary hash.
